# Minimum Snippet Finder – Java Tool

## 🗂️ Overview
This project is a Java-based tool designed to identify the shortest text snippet in a document that contains all given search terms. It was built as part of a university assignment focused on applying algorithm design and performance optimization to real-world text processing problems.

The tool is intended to work efficiently even with large datasets (e.g., 1,000+ word documents) by using optimized search and parsing strategies.

## 🛠️ Features
- Parses text documents to locate search terms
- Finds the minimum-length snippet containing all query terms
- Designed for large-scale datasets (tested with 1,000+ documents)
- Command-line interface for specifying input and queries
- Modular Java classes with clear separation of concerns
